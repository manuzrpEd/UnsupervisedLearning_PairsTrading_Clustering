We want to detect pairs in a universe of trading securities, using various unsupervised learning models. 

Our signal to trade is a stock that deviates substantially from its group of similar behaviour.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/addarm/lagged-firm-characteristics-han2022.\
This dataset has been curated for the papers “Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning”(2018) and “Autoencoder Asset Pricing Models.” (2019) by Shihao Gu, Bryan Kelly and Dacheng Xiu.

The dataset has 94 one-month-Lagged Firm Characteristics as the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) releases these with a month delay.
